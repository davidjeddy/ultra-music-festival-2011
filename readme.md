# Ultra Music Festival 2011

## Background
A website for my Ultra Music Festival 2011 trip.

## Features
 - Image gallery light box
 - `borrowed` music player

## Goal
N/A 

## Requirements
 - Web Browser
 
## Road map
None; this project repository is for historic reference only.

## Usage
Clone the repository locally:
```
cd /project/root/parent
git clone https://github.com/davidjeddy/ultra-music-festival-2011.git
cd ./ultra-music-festival-2011
```

Open `index.html`, allow flash (if it's even possible) in a browser.

## Warning
This was a quick throw together website meant to mirror the theme of the offical event. All I did was add a image
gallery and removed all but one song from the player.

This site IS NOT:
 - Secure
 - Pragmatic
 - Best practice adhering
 - An example of any sort of decent practices; if anything this is what you should NOT be doing
